				<h2>Why Do We Need a Society of Decision Professionals&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>The term decision analysis has been part of the corporate and academic 
vernacular for the last half century. Despite acceptance of the term, 
actual usage of the methodology has not fulfilled its promise. Even when
 faced with the most difficult, complex, and risky decisions, the 
majority of Decision&nbsp;Makers do not turn to Decision Professionals for 
guidance. The reasons for this are many and varied, but it is clear that
 the profession has not been effective at conveying the value 
proposition and many Decision&nbsp;Makers have not even heard of Decision 
Analysis. Without a clear voice speaking for the profession as a whole, 
it is unlikely that the situation will change. This is what the Society 
of Decision Professionals aims to address.</p>
				<p>However, simply making Decision&nbsp;Makers aware of the profession is not 
enough; we need to create the infrastructure and interconnections to 
support the development of the Society. The Society must create clear 
distinctions of competence and value creation in the minds of 
Decision&nbsp;Makers to be successful in creating a step change in 
understanding and adoption. It is not unreasonable for a Decision&nbsp;Maker 
to stipulate that a Decision Professional be accredited to assist on the
 most important decisions the Decision&nbsp;Makers face. As a profession we 
need to create standards and expectations of quality, ethics, and value 
to be delivered so that Decision&nbsp;Makers are comfortable that the people 
they turn to are suitably qualified, have the&nbsp;right level of experience 
and will genuinely help them. This implies that the Society needs to 
define a body of knowledge that constitutes the core of the profession 
and declare a code of ethics that we can all subscribe to.</p>
				<p>The Society will foster collaboration, continual learning and 
networking amongst its members and other professional societies and 
organizations so that as a growing community we can truly serve the best
 interests of the Decision&nbsp;Maker. Finally, the Society of Decision 
Professionals will collaborate with the Decision Analysis Society in 
taking the latest developments in the field of Decision Analysis into 
practical application, thereby ensuring the sustainable long-term 
development of the field of Decision Analysis as a whole.</p>
