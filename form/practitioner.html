<h1>Experienced Practitioner</h1>
<p>Self-identifying as an "experienced practitioner" means that you agree to have your name listed, with email contact information, under the DecisionPedia page for the indicated topic, so that you may be contacted by other members who have questions about the topic. The term "experienced practitioner" indicates that you have sufficient knowledge and experience to act as an informed resource about the topic.  It does not require that you be one of the top experts in that field, but rather that you could discuss most elements of the topic in an informed way or be able to direct the person to deeper resources needed to answer their questions.</p>
<p>This is intended primarily to be a way for members to find and ask basic questions of other experienced members who are willing to volunteer their expertise for the betterment of the society, and not a means for listing or marketing consultant services. This does not preclude the interaction advancing to a consulting arrangement if the discussion proceeds beyond a basic response to the inquiry - it is up to the members involved to work that out.</p>
