<h2>Six Steps to Making a Quality Decision</h2>
<p><em>Steve Begg, The University of Adelaide<br />
		</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">STORY: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">6 steps to a good decision
– original version was published online by Telstra Insights in 2017. This is version is slightly
updated.</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Professor Steve Begg is a lecturer at the University of Adelaide where he researches the ways
people make decisions, particularly under uncertain conditions. His expertise also draws on
his career in the oil and gas sector spanning several decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>"We are interested in finding the most effective processes for people to make decisions that
are in their, not someone else’s, interest,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>The outcomes of most major decisions are affected by all kinds of uncertainties that the
decision-maker cannot control, he adds, so the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty –
good decisions can have bad outcomes and vice versa!</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>"Many people in senior leadership positions today, think they are there because they are good
at making decisions; but even bad decisions can deliver good outcomes when you have a
combination of good luck and being in the right place at the right time.”</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Sure, decision making is an art; it’s also a science, Begg says. "People do postgraduate
degrees in this field.”</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Humans – no matter how intelligent - fall prey to a whole range of systematic biases, Begg
says. Often the way we prefer to make decisions is counter to how we should make them, he
says.&nbsp; "Our intuition is often very wrong in situations of novelty, complexity and
uncertainty.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Decision making has a formal accepted methodology – and even an international professional
organization promoting the underlying principals, the Society of Decision Professionals.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>"Decision science is based on logic and evidence and it has come up with a structured,
pragmatic and scalable application of tools &amp; processes to deliver high quality decisions”
Begg says. The method is Decision Analysis. The scalability is very important - DA
balances the resources (time, effort, cost) needed to make the best decision, with the
importance/difficulty/consequences of the decision (and resources required to implement it).
It actually avoids "paralysis by analysis”.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>"The only part of how your life turns out (or your organization’s) that you can control is your
decisions (and their implementation). By using the methods and processes of "decision
analysis”, people can make higher quality decisions – and so will have the best chance of
achieving their desired outcomes.”</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>How can you bring good decision-making into an organisation? Begin by making sure that
key decision-makers have a good understanding of the six steps of high quality decisions,
says Begg.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/storage/Steve.jpg" alt="6 Steps" border="0" style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;;width:470px;;height:358px;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1: <span style="font-style: italic;">Frame the decision appropriately</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Identify any previous decisions or policies that must be adhered to. Clearly define the
decision that must be made and be sure it is the right/real one – and if there are multiple
related decisions, try to focus on the most important to be made first and defer others to later.

Identify any genuine constraints – but don’t impose any "nice to’s” (eg the project must start
by 1 Jan). Likewise, identify any assumptions and critically assess their validity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: <span style="font-style: italic;">Be clear about your objectives</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>What are the real reasons behind why you’re are going to make the decision? What are you
fundamentally wanting to achieve - how do you define "value” in<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>the context of this
decision? How will you assess or evaluate achievement? Be clear about the priorities when
there are multiple objectives. If you are making a decision on behalf of an organization, make
sure you have not incorporated any personal motivations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3: <span style="font-style: italic;">Develop options</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Here, you need to get creative and identify a good range of distinct "doable” alternatives that
might be selected to achieve your desired outcomes.&nbsp;Avoid small variations on a theme. Rule
out any alternative that does not meet a "must have” or "must do” criterion. Think about
including flexible options that allow you to accelerate/expand/defer/contract/exit as you learn
more about potential outcomes during implementation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4: <span style="font-style: italic;">Gather useful, reliable information</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>What background information do you have? You only need to get extra information that
impacts predicted achievement of your objectives and which has potential to change the
decision you would make without it! How reliable is the information? Is it subject to any
biases – either through collection or analysis?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5: <span style="font-style: italic;">Weigh the evidence and choose the best</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>In this step, you evaluate how the different alternatives might achieve your objectives, and
choose the one that is expected to deliver the most value.&nbsp; Be objective, think rationally -
make sure you are not falling prey to "thinking” biases or motivational biases. If there is
significant uncertainty, use the rules of probability to keep your thinking straight. And make
sure you don’t fall into the trap of trying to get the most precise predictions of the outcomes
of your alternatives – you only need to know enough to identify the best alternative.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 6: &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Commit to action</span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>You haven’t really made the decision, it’s just an idea, until you have assigned the resources
(time, money) required to implement it! And you need an implementation plan, ensuring
everyone involved is "on board” – and, back to step 3, ensuring its "doable”.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>On each of these six steps, only do enough "work” such that doing any more would not
change the decision, or, the cost of doing more outweighs the benefit.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre"></span>Always review the decisions you have made. Document the steps, outline the alternatives and
summarize the reasons for your choice. This makes it easier to revisit decisions in future to
see which aspects or your process are working and which or not - and to distinguish the
impacts on outcome of the things you can control (the quality of your decisions and their
implementation) from those you cannot control (luck, decision of others, "nature”, ….).</p>
