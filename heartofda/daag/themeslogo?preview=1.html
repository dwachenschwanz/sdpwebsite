<h1>SDP Icon - "Heart of DA" Version</h1>
<h3>Heart of DA Workshop&nbsp;</h3>
<p>During DAAG 2015, there was a workshop entitled the Heart of DA workshop, during which participants reflected on these questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What about DA "speaks” to you?</li>
	<li>What about DA deeply resonates with you?</li>
	<li>What parts of DA have you internalized?</li>
	<li>Considering your personal world view, what about DA</li>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li>"strikes a chord” and fits with it?</li>
			<li>significantly altered it?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Participants then answered one of these questions by recording a story from their experience on a note card.&nbsp; In addition to the story, they wrote down key themes embedded in their story.&nbsp; Stories were then shared in pairs and at table groups.&nbsp; Table members identified the most impactful stories, which were shared with the entire group.&nbsp; All participants were encouraged to stop in the video booth during the conference and have their story recorded.</p>
<h3>Post Workshop Output</h3>
<p>At the end of the workshop, participants submitted their story note cards.&nbsp; After the conference, the themes from all the notecards were counted and grouped into themes.&nbsp; Those themes were used to create a new version of the SDP icon.&nbsp; The more times a theme was listed by participants, the larger that word appears in the icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
