<div><br />
	</div>
<div>The Alliance is a national nonprofit organization driving a revolutionary shift in the way we think about education, leading the growing call for Decision Education to be part of every student’s learning experience. Its mission is to improve lives by empowering students with essential skills and dispositions for making better decisions. The decisions they make shape their lives and those of the people around them. Therefore, there is no more important set of skills that can be taught to today’s youth than how to improve the decisions they make.</div>
<div><br />
	</div>
<div>Backed by experts in the decision sciences, business, and education, including several Nobel laureates, the Alliance believes that better decisions lead to better lives and a better society.</div>
<div><br />
	</div>
<div>The Alliance is committed to an inclusive, supportive, and collaborative culture. Their team is made up of diverse, dedicated, and driven educators, researchers, subject matter experts, and other professionals who have come together from different backgrounds for a common purpose. It is a proud Equal Opportunity Employer.</div>
<div><br />
	</div>
<div>The Alliance for Decision Education was founded in 2014 as the How I Decide Foundation through the vision and generous support of two accomplished decision-makers, Annie Duke and Eric Brooks. Both realized that the skills they were leveraging every day with highly successful results were rarely taught to K-12 students, creating a meaningful gap between children’s potential and their reality. They founded the Alliance to close that gap. Over the next four years, the organization built effective and engaging Decision Education programs that reached tens of thousands of teachers and students and had measurable and positive results. That success ignited a drive to scale the work of How I Decide to a national level to benefit millions of students. To achieve this, How I Decide became the Alliance for Decision Education in 2018, refocusing and committing to becoming a field builder and catalyst, sparking and growing support for Decision Education to be implemented in schools nationwide.</div>
<div><br />
	</div>
<div>&nbsp;Toward that end, the Alliance is actively building:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Public awareness</li>

	<li>Standards and frameworks for curricula and pedagogy</li>
	<li>Policy commitments at the state, federal, and local level</li>

	<li>Research and evidence on the efficacy of Decision Education</li>
	<li>Partnerships with like-minded leaders and organizations</li>
	<li>An ongoing commitment to identifying, coordinating, and amplifying all of those related efforts</li>
</ul>To drive this critical work, the Alliance has implemented significant changes in strategy, staffing, and operations, while maintaining the same steadfast mission.<br />

<div><br />
	</div>
<div>Currently, the organization has 37 employees with a plan to grow to 40-45 employees in 2024. The Alliance had unrestricted revenues of $6.2M in 2022. In addition, in 2022, they received $10M in restricted funding for research.</div>
