<h1>Privacy Policy <br />

<h2>Society of Decision
Professionals Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>Last Updated
Effective: October 30, 2014<br />
	</p>
<p>We respect your
privacy and are committed to protecting your personally identifiable
information. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
to explain what information may be collected on this site ("Site")
and how such information may be used and/or shared with others. This Privacy
Policy applies solely to information collected through this Site and not
through any other sources. This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Use
posted on this Site ("Terms of Use"). Please return to this Site and
review this Privacy Policy from time to time, as it may be amended without
notice by posting of a new policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be
effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy on this
Site. Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">YOUR INFORMATION AND
HOW WE USE IT</span><br />
	This Site collects two kinds of information: (1) information that personally
identifies you (such as your name and e-mail address); and (2) information that
does not personally identify you (such as the number of users who log on to the
Site on a daily basis). As a general policy, no personally identifiable
information is automatically collected from your visit to this Site. However,
in certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us with some specific
information about yourself in order to use specific features on the Site, such
as surveys and promotions. Such information may
include contact information (such as your name and/or e-mail address), and
other information as we may require. The personally identifiable information
you submit will be used to carry out your requests and respond to your
inquiries. To accomplish this, we may share your personally identifiable
information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on
behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that deliver
merchandise, participate in our promotions, administer our promotions,
administer our Site, provide marketing or promotional assistance, process
credit card payments, analyze data or provide customer service (but such
information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to
perform their functions). Such third parties are under contract with us, and
the terms of those contracts include confidentiality provisions that prohibit
these third parties from disclosing any personal information collected on this
Site with anyone other than us. Your personally identifiable information may
also be used by us or shared with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates to
provide you with product information, and promotional and other offers. You may
always request us (by contacting us at the address/number listed below) to
modify, delete or not to share your personally identifiable information or not
to use it to provide you with such information or offers. We may also use your
information as otherwise disclosed at the point where such information is
collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the
particular feature of the Site. Except as provided herein, your personally
identifiable information will not be provided to any third parties without
prior approval from you.</p>
<p>From time to time, we
may collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the
standard operation of our servers. Such information can include the type of
browser being used (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the operating system you
are using (e.g., Windows Vista, Macintosh), the domain name of your Internet
service provider (e.g., Comcast, AOL), and the number of users that visit a
specific page on the Site and the character and duration of such visits. This
information may be used to help analyze site traffic and improve our services.
We may also aggregate such information to create statistical data and share it
with potential advertisers, partners, affiliates and other third parties. At no
point, however, will the aggregated information personally identify you.</p>
<p>We reserve the right
to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable
information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that
such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b)
conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served
on us; (c) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Company, this
Site, or its users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of
this Site's users or the general public.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHILDREN UNDER 13</span><br />
	This Site is operated in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act. We do not request children under the age of 13 to provide more
personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate
in an activity on the Site. In any event, Children under the age of 13 should
not provide any personally identifiable information on the Site without the
knowledge and permission of a parent or guardian. If (at the point where a
user's personally identifiable information is collected) we determine that such
user is under the age of 13, the personally identifiable information provided
by such user will not be used or maintained without the consent of his/her
parent or guardian. In certain circumstances, we may require children under the
age of 13 to provide us with the contact information for their parent or legal
guardian. We will use this information (i) to notify such parents or legal
guardians of their children's participation in an activity on the Site and of
our privacy practices, (ii) to seek consent to their children's participation
in an activity on the Site and/or (iii) other legally permissible purposes.
Without his/her parent's or legal guardian's permission, a child under the age
of 13 may not be able to participate in certain activities. A parent or legal
guardian can request that we remove, change or refuse further submission of
information relating to a child under the age of 13 by contacting us at the
address/number below. Any such request must contain the child's name, address
and e-mail address so we can locate such child's information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP ADDRESS</span><br />
	An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP
address. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to
report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track the use of the
Site. When visitors request pages from the Site, our servers log the visitors'
IP addresses. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything
personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged,
but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use
IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce
compliance with the Site's polices or to protect our service or customers, the
Site, or others.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">COOKIES</span><br />
	"Cookies" are small text files from a Web site that are stored on
your hard drive. These small text files make using a Web site more convenient
by saving your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not
contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information
derived from these cookies and match such information with data provided by you
or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personally
identifiable information to potential partners, advertisers (who may use this
information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests) or other
third parties, but we will not disclose any personally identifiable
information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Also, we may allow
third parties that serve advertisements on our Site (including our promotion
partners) to place and access cookies on your computer, but they will not be
able to access our cookies. The use of cookies by such third parties is not
subject to our Privacy Policy, but is subject to their own respective privacy
policies.</p>
<p>You can have the
option of deciding whether or not to accept a cookie by resetting your browser
to notify you whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also
delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Please note, however, that some
parts of this Site will not function properly or will be considerably slower if
you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable your cookies settings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KEEPING YOUR
INFORMATION SECURE</span><br />
	We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place to protect
against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally
identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your
personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TRANSFER OF ASSETS</span><br />
	As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If
another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets,
personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information,
and any other information that we have collected about the users of the Site
will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if
any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all
such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or
transferred to third parties.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OTHER SITES</span><br />
	This Site may contain links to other web sites that we do not own or operate.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by these other web
sites. We encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the
privacy statements of such other web sites before submitting any personally
identifiable information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Links to Third Party

	The Society of Decision Professionals has not reviewed all of the sites linked
to this site and is not responsible for the content of any off-site link or any
