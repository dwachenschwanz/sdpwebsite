<h1>SDP Webinar - March 2024</h1>
<h2>Technology Implementation at Capital One</h2>
<div>The implementation of new technology can give strategic advantages to compa- nies facing competitive pressures, but such projects are often plagued with delays and dissatisfaction among customers and employees. Capital One was planning to roll out check imaging technology to tellers in the 1,000 branches of its retail bank. The literature provides guidance to companies like Capital One planning a major technology implementation, including using a quantitative planning process, involving a diverse set of stakeholders, and reducing information asymmetry. We initially used multiattribute utility theory as a quantitative model to support the planning process. Although our initial approach provided a quantitative view of the impact of various rollout alternatives on the organization, the executives realized that the impacts could vary greatly across business areas. We developed a new approach using group decision theory that provided both individual views on each business area and a combined view. Realizing that each of their current alternatives adversely affected some business areas, the executive stakeholders used the findings to develop a new rollout strategy. Using the new strategy, Capital One avoided the delays experienced by other banks implementing the same technology and saved approximately $30 million while improving customer and employee satisfaction.</div>
