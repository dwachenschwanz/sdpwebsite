Provided</span></p>
	<p>The Society of Decision
Professionals is proud to sponsor a very special leadership course offering to
the European community. Past SDP presidents and decision professional fellows,
Carl Spetzler, president of Strategic Decision Group and Ellen Coopersmith,
president of Decision Frameworks have joined forces to provide this
opportunity. Two key topics will be covered with interactive, facilitated discussions
as concepts are shared for a uniquely focused and eventful day. This workshop is
designed for an eclectic group: leaders wanting to hone their decision skills, and
decision professionals looking to broaden their impact on their organizations and
DQ management championship.</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everyday Decision Quality
Leaders and Project Managers</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Morning session</span></p>
	<p>Leaders and project managers from
all walks of life make important decisions on a regular basis, many of which cannot
wait for formal, time intensive processes. To address this unmet need, we take
the six essential elements of Decision Quality and ground today’s leaders in
how to apply them quickly with guides, tools and awareness to enable informed
decisions. The goal is a rapid, quality way of thinking. The result is
transformational leadership able to utilize Decision Quality BIG and SMALL. </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Becoming an Effective Decision
Leader with Decision Makers that Outrank You</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Afternoon session</span></p>
	<p>The second part of the day focuses on effective facilitation
of decision maker conversations. As leaders of strategic decision projects, we
face many challenges in driving to Decision Quality with Decision Makers that
usually outrank us. We have to build conflict management skills and
facilitation techniques that can be deployed in the moment. We have to speak
truth to power – but in a way that our truth can be heard.&nbsp; We have to
overcome biases and deeply held beliefs.&nbsp; We have to redirect advocacy
into productive generation of alternatives and finding the best among those
alternatives. In this session we will learn best practices based on many
decades of experience, success and lessons learned. </p>
