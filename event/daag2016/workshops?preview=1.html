				<h3>Enriching Your Frame - Use of Scenario Thinking for Strategy Development</h3>    
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructors: </span>Ellen Coopersmith and Kent Burkholder, Decision Frameworks    
  </div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>Some decision problems benefit greatly from the incorporation of scenario thinking into the framing workflow. Scenario thinking is a practical, efficient approach to scenario planning involving the creation of hypothetical future business scenarios designed to raise decision maker awareness of alternative futures and prepare companies for shifts in the business environment. This workshop will introduce a merged scenario planning - decision analysis framing workflow, which was developed after many years of observation that both classic decision analysis framing and classic scenario planning can suffer from weak elements which improve immensely when the two processes are successfully merged.</div><br />
				
				<div>Merging decision analysis (DA) framing and scenario planning provides a complimentary workflow for high level, strategic decision workshops. This is especially true when decision problems include many external, macro uncertainties, associated with socio-economic, political and or environmental issues, in which DA frames can fall short. For those problems, inserting scenario planning into the DA framing workflow provides better understanding of different possible futures and deeper insight from which to develop more robust strategies to consider. Likewise, DA framing brings needed structure to the strategy development element of the scenario planning process, which can be tortuous in many traditional instances.</div><br />
				
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take away from the workshop:</span></div>
				<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Practice framing strategic decisions using scenario planning and traditional DA framing techniques.</div>

				<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;Describing the different scenarios using questions to help develop the "worlds”.</div>
				<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;Developing strategies for each future world.</div>
				<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;Testing the robustness of each strategy in the other worlds</div>

				<h5>Workshop 2 (afternoon):</h5>  
				<h3>The Skills and Science of Facilitative Questioning</h3>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructors: </span>Kathryn Rosback, KRE Inc; Tyler Ludlow, Eli Lilly and Company</div><br />
				
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>For a team faced with a need to find new solutions or one tasked with making collaborative complex decisions, a step-by-step framework or a well-structured set of templates or even the sincere desire to be collaborative is not enough. Today's leading business consultants and innovation thought leaders are calling for the need to spend more time in the questioning mode to shift unproductive patterns of thought and talk, re-frame problems, and improve innovation. But it's not just any question: it is essential that the facilitator have some skill in the art of facilitative questioning. This engaging and interactive workshop will introduce participants to the science and psychology of question types and structure, and provide opportunities to practice question application using participative case studies.</div>

				<h5>Workshop 3 (full-day):</h5>  
				<h3>Biases in Decision Making</h3>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructors: </span>Jennifer Meyer and Carl Spetzler, Strategic Decisions Group</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>Humans naturally fall victim to hundreds of biases and traps, particularly in decision making. A recent explosion in behavioral decision science research has led to many new publications and popular books. This presents a challenge for the decision professional, because the field of biases is so vast and detailed, it’s nearly impossible to comprehend it. And describing the behaviors is not enough.</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div>In this workshop, SDG will share their framework for organizing and understanding the decisionrelated biases. Through interactive discussions and live experiments, participants will learn to recognize a variety of critical decision traps, as well as the megabiases that arise from the combined effects of these biases. The workshop will also introduce an approach for avoiding these biases. Participants will share best practices, brainstorm new solutions, and develop personal strategies to create more effective prescriptive guidance for decision makers.</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div>This program is designed for decision professionals seeking to improve the effectiveness of their decision leadership. It features highlights of the three-day biases course in the Stanford certificate program in Strategic Decision and Risk Management. It also integrates the latest thinking from the forthcoming book Decision Quality: Value Creation from Better Business Decisions (Wiley, 2016), by Carl Spetzler, Hannah Winter, and Jennifer Meyer.</div>
