<h1>SDP Webinar - Jan 2017</h1>
<h2>Capacity Planning in the Biopharmaceutical Industry&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Jan 11, 2017</h3>
<div>8-9 am PT | 11-12 pm ET&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Speaker:&nbsp;Phil Beccue, White Deer Partners, Inc.<br />
	Moderator: Enrico Manlapig, Westmont College &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Making long-term commitments with large capital investments in biological manufacturing facilities requires a careful balancing of supply and demand. &nbsp;Decision-makers struggle with two competing issues: &nbsp;the risk of under-supply that results in lost value to patients, profits, and brand reputation; and the possibility of over-supply that results in underutilized assets. &nbsp;Forecasting demand for 20 years, a key element for these decisions, is highly uncertain due to external competition, internal cannibalization, and disruptive technologies. &nbsp;Our team recently employed decision analysis techniques to bring confidence on the best path forward for meeting product demand and maximizing long-term value to the business.</p>
<p>This webinar will inspire newer DA professionals and advanced students with practical ideas to:</p>
<p>-<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Help business leaders move from deterministic to probabilistic thinking</p>
<p>-<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Employ tornado sensitivity analyses to focus attention</p>
<p>-<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Simplify complexity for busy managers with short attention spans</p>
<p>-<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Achieve unbiased forecasts from biased experts</p>
