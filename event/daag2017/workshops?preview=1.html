				<h3>Value-Focused Decision-Making</h3>    
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructor: </span>Ralph L. Keeney, Duke University</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract: </span>This workshop addresses five key aspects of good decision-making:</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Thinking about first things first, specifically identifying your values for any decision to describe what you hope to achieve before beginning to solve it</li>
					<li>Taking more control of your decision problems that occur, by creating alternatives better than those initially available</li>
					<li>Being a proactive decision maker, by creating your own decisions, referred to as decision opportunities, to raise your quality of life above where it currently is</li>
					<li>Removing constraints of others on alternatives that you desire to pursue</li>
					<li>Providing a consistent guide for all of your decisions by describing how to identify, organize, and use your strategic life values</li>
				</ul>Good decision-making requires skills that can be practiced and improved. Concepts and procedures to develop the decision-making skills mentioned above are thoroughly described and illustrated by numerous real applications.<br />
				<br />
				
				<div>This workshop is limited to 40 participants.</div>                <br />

				<h3>Valuing Information – Sharpening Skills to Make Quality Testing and Piloting Decisions</h3>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructors:&nbsp;</span>Ellen
Coopersmith and Luis Mendoza, Decision Frameworks</div><br />
				
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:&nbsp;</span>Businesses are often faced with technology advances which have the potential to "change the game” …execute their business in a better, faster or cheaper manner. Unfortunately, risk is often associated with the use of some new technologies, making the decision to deploy difficult. When this occurs, testing or piloting the technology prior to full scale implementation may be considered.</div>
				<div>This workshop introduces a practical, repeatable approach to framing and evaluating test or pilot decisions. Faced with a new technology case example, attendees will practice framing testing options, with different costs associated, forecasting the amount of risk/uncertainty reduction associated with each and valuing the business case for the different tests considered.</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take away from the workshop:</span></div>
				<ul>
					<li>Understanding of the fundamentals of valuing information</li>
					<li>Step-wise workflow to value of information (VOI) decision problems</li>
					<li>Means to conduct "uncertainty reduction” assessment interviews</li>
					<li>Introduction to uncertainty reduction vs. test cost plots</li>
					<li>Decision trees to value test options considering 100% reliable and imperfect information tests</li>
				</ul>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who should attend this workshop?</span></div>
				<div>Decision analysts, planners and managers supporting testing, piloting or other information /de-risking decisions.<br />
					</div><br />
				
				<div>This workshop is limited to 30 participants.</div>

				<h3>Building Organizational Decision Quality</h3>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructors: </span>Carl Spetzler and Mazen Skaf, Strategic Decisions Group <br />
					<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organized </span>by Bruce Judd, Strategic&nbsp;Decisions Group</span></div>
				<div><br />
					</div>
				<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:&nbsp;</span>In a workshop setting, participants will learn principles and best practices for building organizational decision quality (ODQ). In facilitated breakout group sessions, we will discuss the challenges that we foresee or have faced in our own organizations, with an opportunity to learn from each other.</div>
				<div>The workshop is built on these elements:</div>
				<ul>  
					<li>A pre-course survey of all participants</li>
					<ul style="list-style: circle inside">
						<li style="list-style: circle inside">What is the current level of ODQ within your domain in the organization?</li>
						<li style="list-style: circle inside">What types of decisions could benefit most:</li>                            
						<ul style="list-style: square inside">                              
							<li style="list-style: square inside">"Strategic” decisions that are very complex, they are worked on for weeks or months, and they shape the future of the organization</li>
							<li style="list-style: square inside">"Significant” decisions that are important or complex but merit only a few hours of work before they are made</li>                            
						</ul>                    
					</ul>                    
					<li>Presentations by the instructors with these themes</li>                    
					<ul style="list-style: circle inside">

					</ul>                    
					<li>Breakout group discussions on overcoming challenges identified in the survey&nbsp;</li>                      
					<ul style="list-style: none inside">                          
						<li style="list-style: none inside">Participants will be grouped by the type of challenges they face. Further segmentation will be based on participants’ roles in organizations:</li>

						</ul>                          
						<li style="list-style: none inside">Because the results of the survey will not be known until near the time of the workshop, the content of each breakout group discussion will be established immediately prior to the workshop</li>                          
						<li style="list-style: none inside">Facilitators for each breakout group will be chosen based on breakout content and facilitators’ experience levels. There will be a short report-back to all participants by the facilitator from each discussion</li>                      
					</ul>                      
					<li>Short case studies from organizations that have been recognized for their achievements in ODQ (for example, Raiffa-Howard Award winners)</li>                      
					<ul style="list-style: none inside">                          
						<li style="list-style: none inside">The case-study presenters will be selected from among the Society's most experienced practitioners.</li>
						<li style="list-style: none inside">The presenters and topics will be based on major themes identified in the survey or those anticipated before final survey results are in.&nbsp;</li>                          
						<li style="list-style: none inside">The case studies will be limited to 15-20 minutes each, in most cases following the breakout sessions.</li>
						<li style="list-style: none inside"> Presenters should include "encouragement and cautions” on ideas reported back from breakout discussions</li>                      
					</ul>                      
					<li>Summary and Wrap-up by workshop leaders</li>
