<h1>SDM Researcher Program</h1>
<h5>Background</h5>
<p>While the SDM Summit is primarily a discussion-based, rather than presentation-based event, there is still a need to have independent voices "teeing up" certain topics.&nbsp; This is a perfect fit for many SDM researchers, which have been around the SDM block a time or two, and have seen opportunities, gaps, or barriers, but may not been in a position to take advantage of or solve them.&nbsp; If you'd like to see research insights be implemented more frequently and broadly, this is your chance!</p>
<h5>Program Benefits</h5>
<p>Those selected to the program will receive an opportunity to present and participate at the Summit.&nbsp; Additionally, financial benefits include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Summit registration fee</li>
	<li>Travel reimbursement</li>
	<li>Reservations and meals at Mohonk (3 nights/days)</li>
	<li>Speaker honorarium ($500)</li>
</ul>
<h5>How to Apply</h5>
<p>To apply, simply submit your ideas about how to shape a topic.&nbsp; You may submit ideas about as many topics as you would like, just do so one topic at a time.&nbsp; The deadline for submitting ideas to be a part of this program is <span style="font-weight: bold;">23 Nov 2017</span>.&nbsp; The SDM Summit Steering Committee will then select at least 4 individuals to receive an award.&nbsp; All participants will be notified by early to mid December.</p>
