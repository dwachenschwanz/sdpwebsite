<h3>Patients Included Rationale</h3>
<p>Below is our rationale for claiming Patients Included.  Clauses from the website are listed below, with minor editing to include footnotes in paragrahs.</p>
<table>

			<td style="padding:30px;">              
				<h5>Clause 1: &nbsp;</h5>
				<h3>Designing and Planning</h3>     
				<p>Patients or caregivers with experience relevant to the conferenceâ€™s central theme actively participate in the design and planning of the event, including the selection of themes, topics and speakers..</p>              
              
				<h5>How this is fulfilled:</h5>       
				<ul>
					<ul>                
						<li>The Summit is designed and planned by a Steering Committee.&nbsp; Four of the members that committee, or approximately a third of its members, are patients and caregivers.</li>                
						<li>These patient advisers were selected in part because of their experience within the healthcare system, including participating in many, many healthcare decision making processes.&nbsp; Some come with wonderful examples of participating in Shared Decision Making with their providers, others with examples of how it could be done better.&nbsp; </li>
						<li>Three of the four patient advisers have participated in the previous SDM Summit in Sep 2016.</li>

				<h5>How this is fulfilled:</h5>       
				<ul>
					<ul>                
						<li>All of the patient advisers will be speaking at the Summit.&nbsp; Some may be facilitating breakout group workshop discussions.</li>                
						<li>The SDM Summit is more of a working group than a conference.&nbsp; Hence, there is a "team" of participants rather than an "audience."&nbsp; All four patient advisers will team members, ie equal and active discussion participants, when not speaking.</li>
