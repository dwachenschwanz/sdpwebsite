	<h2>How to apply for SDP Certification</h2>
	<p>Please
 note that there is no fee for certification, it is a benefit of 
membership in the Society of Decision Professionals. There is no 
requirement for certification to be a member of the Society.  Because of
 the effort by Society volunteers, certification can only be assessed 
for candidates who are members.</p>

	<h3>Fellows</h3>
	<p>As
 well as the "Practitioner" and "Lead Practitioner" designations the 
society will also include "Fellow" level membership.  A Fellow, in 
addition to meeting all the Lead Practitioner requirements, will also 
need to accumulate enough experience, be elected by other fellows, be a 
role model for the society's members, and help improve the decision 
analysis practice. So, to be designated as fellow, members need to:</p>
	<h3>Have 5 FTE Experience &amp; Are Elected by Fellows</h3>
	<p>Fellows
 need at least 5 years full-time equivalent experience in applying 
Decision Analysis. They need to be elected by at least three other 
fellows.</p>
	<h3>Be Role Models</h3>
	<p>Fellows need to be role models for
 members of the society - with other members wanting to emulate their 
decision analysis capabilities. Examples of what it means to be a role 
model include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Capable of walking into any situation, even in the most destructive 
of meetings, taking hold of the meeting and resolving the issues</li>
		<li>Considered the DA subject matter expert among their colleagues</li>
		<li>Widely respected by the society's members for their knowledge and experience</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Help Improving the Practice</h3>
	<p>Fellows
 need to help undertake activities that will improve the decision 
analysis practice. Examples of how they may improve the practice 
include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Developing and cascading new approaches, tools, and methods to improve the application of DA.</li>
		<li>Leading communities of practice to share best practice between organizations.</li>
		<li>Actively coaching and mentoring all levels of the profession to create the society's next generation.</li>
